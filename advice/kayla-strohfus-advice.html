                <h4>Don't Give Up!</h4>

                <p>When you are learning to code and you think you're out of your league. Throw that thought in the trash and burn it! You got this!</p>

                <p>When things get tough, take a break and come back to it later!</p>

                <h4>Practice, Practice, and Practice Some More!</h4>

                <p>Pratice makes perfect as they say. When learning something new i.e. to code, you'll want to keep practicing techniques and skills to make it stick!</p>

                <p>Daily practice of a new skill will make it not so new when it's done daily!</p>
